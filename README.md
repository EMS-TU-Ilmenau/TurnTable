# Turntable
Construction of a low-cost turntable positioner including 3D-printable parts and software to control it

## Dependencies
While the table could be driven by a wide range of motors, the construction was planned in mind with a stepper motor controlled by [StepperDrive](https://github.com/EMS-TU-Ilmenau/StepperDrive).
